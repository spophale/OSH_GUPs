The Makefile for this package is set up to use the "osh" wrappers that
have been adopted by a number of OpenSHMEM implementations.  These are
not part of the standard though, so your setup may be different.

For example, you can specify a vendor compiler such as Intel's icc or
PGI's pgcc and then supply explicit header and library locations.

    CC             = pgcc
    LD             = $(CC)

    SHMEM_INC_PATH = -I/opt/openshmem/include
    SHMEM_LDFLAGS  =
    SHMEM_LIBS     = -L/opt/openshmem/lib -lshmem

Or, if you have pkg-config support, you might be able to say something
like:

    SHMEM_INC_PATH = $(shell pkg-config --cflags openshmem ompi)
    SHMEM_LDFLAGS  =
    SHMEM_LIBS     = $(shell pkg-config --libs openshmem ompi)
